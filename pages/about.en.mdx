# About

The Prompt Engineering Guide is a tutorial project initiated by [DAIR.AI](https://github.com/dair-ai), translated and improved by [NCUHOME](team.ncuos.com) and the Chinese open-source community, aimed at helping researchers and industry professionals understand prompt engineering.

With the goal of spreading AI technology and research achievements, we welcome everyone's contributions! You can find the edit button on the page to participate in contributions.

If you are interested in this tutorial or have any questions, you can join our community for further discussion. Since the WeChat QR code is only valid for seven days, we only provided the Feishu group here. If you want to join the WeChat community, you can contact the Feishu group administrator or add the WeChat assistant at `ncudiven`.
