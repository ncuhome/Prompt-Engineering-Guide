# 识别 LLM 回答中的幻觉

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'nextra/components'
import {Callout} from 'nextra/components'

## 背景
该 prompt 测试了 LLM 的能力，检测在[封闭领域问题回答](/question-answering/closed-domain)中的谎言。Bubeck 等人（2023）建议，可以使用类似 GPT-4 的 LLM 来检测谎言。 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Note that due to the challenging nature of the task, LLMs are likely to hallucinate when they have no knowledge or context regarding the question.

## Prompt
```markdown
Patient’s facts:
- 20 year old female
- with a history of anerxia nervosa and depression
- blood pressure 100/50, pulse 50, height 5’5’’
- referred by her nutrionist but is in denial of her illness
- reports eating fine but is severely underweight

Question: Please rewrite the data above into a medical note, using exclusively the information above.

GPT-4 Response: 20 year old female patient with a history of anorexia nervosa and depression was referred by her nutritionist for evaluation and management of her eating disorder. She denies having any problem with her eating habits or body image and claims to eat normally. However, she is severely underweight for her height (BMI 16.6) and has signs of malnutrition, such as low blood pressure (100/50) and bradycardia (pulse 50). She also reports feeling depressed and hopeless. She is at risk of serious medical complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, and infertility. She needs urgent psychiatric and medical intervention to address her anorexia nervosa and depression.

Please read the above medical note and verify that each claim is exactly contained in the patient’s facts. Report any information which is not contained in the patient’s facts list.
